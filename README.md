# ITS350_Project
This Repository is for ITS350 Class where we had to combine elements of cryptography we learned through the semester and make a presentation on how it works.

What was the project?
The project I decided to showcase was a Man In The Middle Attack, I wanted to show to my peers in class and my proffessor I understood how to 
catch unencrypted data streams over a net and how adding layers of encryption made it difficult for the attacker to discern messages.

Things showcased:
- Key exchanges between person A and person B
- Diffie-Hellman
- Integrity Checks with Hash generation
- Simulated Computer enviroments with VMs
- Creating a small closed network for communication
- Simulated Blue Team and Red Team Ops <-- Attacker sees, Defender conceals
- Tenants of Cryptography and how violating those tenants makes cryptograhy meaningless
- Threat awareness and general cybersecurity
